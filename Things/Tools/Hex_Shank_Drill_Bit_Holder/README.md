Hex Shank Bits Holder
=====================

This is a remix of the hex bit holder by TBRIshtar on Thingiverse:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:241501

This remix mimics the original as close as possible but has the following
features:
 - Any number of rows and columns
 - Holes can be round or hexagonal
 - Hole sizes can be set.
 - Footer height can be adjusted
 - Wall height can be adjusted
 - Edge widths can be adjusted.
 - Fully customizable in newer versions of OpenSCAD with the built in
     Customizer, or on Thingiverse using the Customizer app.

I use the OpenSCAD fillets lib https://github.com/jfhbrook/openscad-fillets
by jhfbrook for filleting the edges - Thanks jhfbrook!
